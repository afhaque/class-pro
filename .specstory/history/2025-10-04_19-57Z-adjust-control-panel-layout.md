I'll examine the control panel component and fix the layout to move the controls to the far left and keep the scenario on the far right.

Looking at the current layout, I can see the issue. The controls (recording, microphone, camera, leave call) are currently centered in the main container with `justify-center`, while the scenario controls are positioned absolutely in the top-right. I need to change the layout to put the controls on the far left and keep the scenario controls on the far right.

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the control panel layout. Here's what I changed:

## Plan
- Move the video/audio controls to the far left
- Keep the scenario controls on the far right
- Use flexbox with `justify-between` to separate the two sections

## Changes Made
1. **Changed the main container layout**: Updated from `justify-center` to `justify-between` to spread elements across the full width
2. **Wrapped controls in a left container**: Added a `<div>` with `flex items-center gap-3` to group the video/audio controls on the left
3. **Moved scenario controls inline**: Removed the absolute positioning and made the scenario controls part of the main flex layout on the right side

## Result
- **Left side**: Recording, microphone, camera, and leave call buttons are now grouped together on the far left
- **Right side**: Scenario dropdown, Run button, and Test Transcript button remain on the far right where they were positioned before

The layout now properly separates the core video call controls from the testing/scenario controls, with the video controls on the far left and scenario controls on the far right as requested.
