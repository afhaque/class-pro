# Convert sentiment and store in ClickHouse (2025-10-04 18:43Z)

_**User (2025-10-04 15:32Z)**_

as messages flow into chat (even in the test case)

use chatgpt to convert the sentiment of confidence from a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the most confident.

Then feed this into click house usin these credentials.

import { createClient } from '@clickhouse/client'

void (async () => {
  const client = createClient({
    url: 'https://d8irwr6qnd.us-east1.gcp.clickhouse.cloud:8443',
    username: 'default',
    password: 'yABbAN.S3f0Og',
  })
  const rows = await client.query({
    query: 'SELECT 1',
    format: 'JSONEachRow',
  })
  console.log('Result: ', await rows.json())
})()

We will later use those credentials to create a graph that shows the sentiment of responses clustered by name of student and clustered over time (as in over the course of a session)

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing sentiment analysis feature**

I need to implement a feature where incoming chat messages are analyzed for sentiment confidence on a scale of 1 to 5 using ChatGPT. I’ll feed this data into ClickHouse with the provided credentials for future graph creation. To achieve this, I’ll modify the existing code to compute sentiment for each message, leveraging the OpenAI API. This will involve intercepting messages and processing them, following the planned steps rigorously and ensuring all relevant data is stored.
**Identifying code features**

I need to perform a parallel search in the codebase to find where messages are sent and stored, along with the test case flows. Sentiment analysis will utilize OpenAI or ChatGPT, and I’ll leverage the existing environment settings and test-openai routes for processing messages and storing in ClickHouse. It’s crucial to avoid storing credentials directly in the code, even though the user has provided them; instead, I'll set them as environment variables. I'll apply code changes using the appropriate editing tools.
**Adding server-side API route**

I’ll create a server-side API route at `app/api/log-sentiment/route.ts` that accepts POST requests containing message content, student name, and session ID or time. This route will call OpenAI to evaluate confidence on a scale of 1 to 5 and then write a corresponding row into ClickHouse. I also need to instantiate a ClickHouse client and add the dependency `@clickhouse/client`. I’ll double-check if I should use `openai` or `@ai-sdk/openai` since the repo might have specific preferences.</details></think>

---

I'll scan the codebase to locate where chat messages are created/sent and any existing OpenAI API usage so I can hook a server route to compute sentiment and write to ClickHouse. Then I’ll implement an API route and wire the client-side to call it on each message.

I noticed the handleTestTranscript function in Transcript.tsx, but the user is interested in how messages flow into the chat, which isn't necessarily about transcripts. It seems like ChatTab handles the scenario streaming that produces messages. I see there's a "startScenarioStream" function mentioned earlier, so I’m planning to check out the beginning of ChatTab.tsx to get a clearer understanding. This will help me answer the user's question more accurately!</details></think>

I'll scan the chat components and API routes to locate where messages are appended so I can hook a sentiment call and then add a new API route to compute sentiment and write to ClickHouse. Then I’ll wire client calls from both live and test message flows.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing confidence sentiment analysis**

I'm setting up a process where incoming messages are analyzed for sentiment confidence on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest confidence. This data will be sent to ClickHouse using the provided credentials. I need to create an API route that accepts the message info, sends it to OpenAI for sentiment analysis, and then writes the results into ClickHouse. I must avoid hardcoding secrets while ensuring the schema includes session info, sender name, timestamp, message text, and a confidence score.
**Setting up sentiment analysis hooks**

I need to identify the right spots to integrate calls in ChatTab's message handling. Specifically, this involves message appending functions like startScenarioStream and handleSubmit. The user requested that as messages flow into chat, we implement a useEffect that watches for new messages lacking sentiment data and triggers the API for computation. I'll utilize processedMessageIds to manage translations but consider creating separate sets for sentiment processing. Additionally, I might add a sentimentScore field to ChatMessage to retain this data for future reference.
**Integrating message logging**

I need to implement a `useEffect` that handles incoming messages, filtering out ones sent by 'You,' unless it's necessary to include them for clustering purposes. The user is interested in all messages, even test cases, which include various senders. They specifically want responses clustered by student names, so I’ll prioritize logging messages where the sender isn't 'You.' We’ll focus on integrating this within ChatTab only, as that aligns with the user's request for processing messages flowing into the chat. Finally, we’ll ensure everything gets written to ClickHouse.
**Setting up ClickHouse integration**

I need to determine which ClickHouse SDK to use, and they provided the `@clickhouse/client` as an example. For the Next.js API route, I’ll import this client and either create a new instance per request or reuse an existing one. The API route will be set up at `app/api/log-conf-sentiment/route.ts`. It will handle parsing the message details and calling OpenAI with the proper key. Since they mentioned using "chatgpt" without specifying a model, I'll go with `gpt-4o-mini` for generating confidence ratings. Finally, I need to ensure we have a table created in ClickHouse for storing the results.
**Creating ClickHouse table**

I need to decide whether to create a ClickHouse table dynamically if it doesn't exist. It’s crucial since an `INSERT INTO` operation would fail without a valid table. I can use a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` query. For the schema, I’ll consider fields like timestamp, sender, message, confidence, source, session_id, and message id. 

My plan is to establish a `ReplacingMergeTree` for deduplication with `id` as the primary key. We'll also ensure to check and create the table before inserting any data, streamlining the process. Lastly, I need to confirm that the `@clickhouse/client` dependency is included in the package.json.</details></think>

---

I'll check dependencies to see if `@clickhouse/client` is installed and then implement a server route to compute confidence via OpenAI and insert into ClickHouse, and wire a client-side effect in `ChatTab.tsx` to call it for new messages.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing sentiment feature**

I need to implement a feature that will convert sentiment into a confidence scale from 1-5 as messages flow into the chat. This data will then be fed into ClickHouse for graphing over time by the student. I’ll create a new API route in the Next.js app, specifically at app/api/log-sentiment/route.ts. I'll use ChatGPT's completions API and access OpenAI with the correct API keys; it seems essential to set the OPENAI_API_KEY for this route. Also, I'll need to add the @clickhouse/client dependency to package.json, which is missing.
**Adding message logging**

I'll make the necessary code changes by updating package.json and creating a new file. I need to log messages for both the ChatTab message flows and the test flows. The ChatTab captures messages as the scenario stream runs and when generateTestMessage adds content, as well as when the user submits their messages. The focus is on logging all ChatTab messages, so I'll implement a useEffect to watch for new messages. For each unprocessed message, I’ll call the new API route with the message text, sender, and timestamp.
**Updating ChatMessage structure**

I need to update the ChatMessage structure to include a processedSentiment boolean or a new Set for processed IDs. Since there's already a processedMessageIds set used for translation, it’s best to create a new state called sentimentProcessedIds to avoid any interference. I'll also cluster messages by name and time using the student name from msg.sender for test scenarios. It seems logical to log all senders, including “You” messages. Additionally, I need to ensure the ClickHouse table exists and create it if it doesn’t before inserting any data.
**Creating the chat_sentiment table**

I can write code to create the database and table if they don't already exist, though permission might be needed. I'll set up the 'chat_sentiment' table with columns for id, student, text, score (either UInt8 or Float32), and timestamp. Including a session ID or source might be helpful, but the session ID isn't currently in the app. For now, I’ll implement fields like message_id, sender, text, confidence_score, and created_at. The server route will handle a POST body for processing sentiment with a prompt that categorizes understanding and confidence levels.
**Inserting data into chat_sentiment**

I'll insert the sentiment data into the 'chat_sentiment' table using the client’s insert method. However, I need to ensure that the column types match, especially for DateTime. While I could set 'created_at' using the default now(), I think it’s important to keep the message time. So, I’ll include 'created_at' converted to the right format. I'll ensure the values object includes 'created_at' as a string formatted appropriately. After implementing the code, I’ll run read_lints on any edited files to check for TypeScript errors. I'll make those edits now!</details></think>

I'll add a new API route to score message confidence and write to ClickHouse, update dependencies to include the ClickHouse client, and wire `ChatTab.tsx` to call the API for each new message.

- [ ] Add @clickhouse/client dependency to package.json
- [ ] Wire ChatTab to call API for new messages (incl. tests)

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating database table**

I see the user hasn't created a table yet. On ClickHouse Cloud, we need to insert into a table, so we might have to create it if it doesn't exist. The @clickhouse/client can handle DDL commands. I think we should ensure the table is created either on each insert or lazily upon first use with a command like "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS." 

I'll name the table `class_pro.chat_sentiment`, and since the cloud endpoint defaults to the 'default' database, we can create it there. The schema looks like it could include timestamp, message_id, sender, text, sentiment confidence, and some nullable fields.
**Structuring the table**

I’m aiming for a simple table creation statement for `chat_sentiments` with relevant fields like event time, session ID, scenario ID, message ID, sender, text, confidence, and score source using the MergeTree engine. 

I know MergeTree needs an ORDER BY clause, which ClickHouse Cloud supports, but I'm a bit concerned about permissions since sometimes users face restrictions.

The user provided credentials, which can be risky to keep in code. I wonder how best to balance using those credentials with security measures.
**Implementing API changes**

I’m thinking we should set credentials directly in the API route, but since the repo is local, it's safer to use environment variables and instruct the user to set them if they haven't already. The user did provide their credentials explicitly, so we could temporarily embed them in the code. Yet, to prioritize security, it might be best to read from `process.env` with a fallback to the provided values. 

Additionally, I need to add a function in `ChatTab`’s `useEffect`, to call the API for logging sentiment for each unprocessed message.
**Managing scenario IDs and sentiment**

I’m considering storing the `scenarioId` in a reference to pass along, especially since it's mentioned as required even in test cases. For testing, we could send an unknown scenario ID or use placeholders like 'scenario-1/2/3/4'. When we call `startScenarioStream`, I can set a `currentScenarioRef`.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that we convert sentiment confidence into a scale from 1-5, with 5 being the most confident. I'll need to configure the API route to use OpenAI chat completions, preferably calling 'gpt-4o-mini' for cost-effectiveness.
**Building the sentiment logging system**

I’m considering how to build the sentiment logging system. We can process message texts to produce confidence ratings from 1 to 5, where 5 indicates the highest confidence. If a message contains numeric strings like '4.4', we can round these to the nearest integer. It makes sense to pre-parse numeric strings; otherwise, we'll call OpenAI.

We'll implement an API route (`/api/log-sentiment`) that accepts a JSON body with essential details. I also want to ensure we add the necessary dependency for `@clickhouse/client` to our project. I'll need to wire this API to the `ChatTab`'s sentiment logging mechanism, ensuring we manage processed IDs effectively to avoid duplicates. Additionally, we'll implement session ID storage in `localStorage` for tracking purposes. 

Then there's the permission and environment configuration for making these API calls. I’ll take a thorough step-by-step approach to ensure everything is in place smoothly!
**Connecting to ClickHouse and updating ChatTab**

After rating the sentiment, I need to connect to ClickHouse using the credentials and ensure the `chat_sentiments` table exists. I’ll execute a query to create it if it doesn't already exist, which sets up the schema properly.

Next, I’ll handle inserting the data using the recommended `JSONEachRow` format for efficient processing. 

Then, I’ll make some updates in `ChatTab.tsx`, like adding a reference for `currentScenarioId`, setting up a session ID state, and tracking processed sentiment IDs. I also plan to filter new messages to log sentiments appropriately and ensure the setup accommodates test cases. Let’s implement these changes!</details></think>

---

I’m going to install the ClickHouse client dependency and start implementing a new API route to score confidence with OpenAI and insert records into ClickHouse. Then I’ll wire `ChatTab.tsx` to post each new incoming message for logging.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up ClickHouse integration**

I see that in the `translate-message`, they used `OPENAI_API_KEY`, while `detect-language` leveraged `OPENAI_HACKATHON_KEY`. I think it’s safer to stick with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and use it as a fallback. 

Next, I’ll add the `@clickhouse/client` dependency, which is already there. I need to set up writing to a ClickHouse table, like `messages_confidence`, ensuring it includes necessary columns. However, there may be restrictions for creating tables in ClickHouse Cloud. I’ll implement the table creation with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` using the correct engine.
**Configuring timestamp and logging**

I see that the appropriate data type for the timestamp is either `DateTime64(3)` or `DateTime`. I’ll go with `DateTime` with time zone. 

Next, I’ll insert rows using the `client.insert` method with the JSONEachRow format. 

For testing in ChatTab, messages are generated with the `sender` field from a selected name in the tests. I’ll hook into the ChatTab's `useEffect` to process new messages. I need to compute confidence for all messages that haven’t been logged yet, excluding those from 'You' to meet the user’s requirements.
**Managing API calls and confidence tracking**

I plan to add a processed set to avoid duplicate calls; I see they’re already using `processedMessageIds` for translation. I could reuse that or create a new set for tracking confidence logs, which I might call `confidenceLoggedIds`. 

Next, I’ll call our new API route with the message text, sender's name, and timestamp to get a confidence sentiment score from OpenAI. 

For test cases like "scenario-3" and "scenario-4," they push numeric strings. I’ll handle this by mapping floats to the nearest 1-5. To save costs, I can skip sending purely numeric messages to OpenAI and compute the sentiment locally, still following their request to use ChatGPT for sentiment conversion.
**Implementing server logic for confidence logging**

I plan to handle number cases on the server, so if the text is a number like '4.4' or '3', we’ll parse that; otherwise, we’ll use OpenAI. 

Next, I'll implement the route path, likely as `app/api/score-and-log-confidence/route.ts`, but I think I’ll keep it simpler as `/api/log-confidence`.

I need to include ClickHouse credentials in the code, as they provided them in plaintext. While it's sensitive, I’ll embed them securely in the environment variables. This way, we can maintain speed while following best practices for safety. I’ll store `CLICKHOUSE_URL`, `CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME`, and `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`.
**Implementing confidence logging route**

I’ll set up a fallback to the constants if the environment variables aren't set. 

Next, I need to update ChatTab to call our route for each new message. I’ll create a `useEffect` that tracks `confidenceLoggingIds`, filtering out messages from 'You' and those already logged. For each valid message, I’ll POST to `/api/log-confidence` without waiting for responses to avoid rate limits.

I’ll also ensure that the helper function `computeConfidenceScore` handles numeric inputs and maps those correctly, while calling OpenAI for other messages. Finally, I’ll establish the connection to ClickHouse to create the necessary table and insert data, while also managing error responses. After that, I can modify ChatTab to include the new logic.</details></think>

I'll create a new API route to score confidence and insert into ClickHouse, and then wire `ChatTab.tsx` to call it for each new incoming message using a processed set to avoid duplicates.

I'm planning to add a useEffect that activates based on the length of messages, allowing us to process new inputs and call /api/log-confidence with details like text, sender, and timestamp. I'll need to avoid duplicates and pay attention to rate limits, perhaps using sequential or small concurrency. The user pointed out that in test cases, streams and functions generate messages from non-'You' senders. I'll make sure to also consider logging from Transcript.tsx as specified for the ChatTab.
**Updating ChatTab for logging**

The user requested that we later use credentials to graph, but for now, we have implemented them. It's crucial to add any necessary TypeScript types. I need to edit ChatTab.tsx by adding a processedConfidenceIds state and a useEffect similar to the translation process for logging new messages. I’ll be using fetch to POST /api/log-confidence, which should return an "ok" true response. To avoid hitting the OpenAI rate limit, I plan to process sequentially with small delays. I'll also need to read the full file to ensure an accurate context for our changes.
**Reading full ChatTab.tsx**

The ChatTab.tsx file is 735 lines long, and I think reading the entire file is the best approach for understanding the context. This way, I can accurately determine where to insert the new state variables and the useEffect for logging. By having the complete context, I minimize the risk of any mistakes when implementing the changes. Let's get started with that!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning code implementation**

I need to implement an effect using `useEffect`, filtering messages based on `loggedConfidenceIds` to log new confidence. If there are no new messages, I'll exit. I’ll log the data via a fetch request, properly handling errors and updating the `loggedConfidenceIds` afterward. It’s essential to avoid ESLint issues by not adding exhaustive dependencies, ensuring no loops occur. After all changes, I should run `read_lints` and then mark the task as completed. Lastly, I must remember the user's rules regarding code output.
**Clarifying code presentation approach**

I need to provide a plan and code blocks for the user, but there's a conflict because "making_code_changes" says I shouldn’t output code directly. However, the guidelines suggest I can reference existing code. I can show code references for new routes and changes in `ChatTab`, highlighting the new effect added. The user asked for logging but didn't specifically request code, so I think it could be okay to include minimal code snippets as references, using CODE REFERENCES for existing code and markdown for new code.
**Proceeding with code references**

I want to make sure I reference the new file we've already added to the codebase. It’s good that I can show this reference to the user, but I need to focus on relevant code quotes to keep things concise. I should not wrap the entire message in code, just include the necessary parts. Once I’ve handled that, I’ll move on to editing `ChatTab` as the next step.</details></think>

---

I'll wire `ChatTab.tsx` to POST each new message to the new API, avoiding duplicates and priming the processed set from any messages loaded from localStorage. Then I’ll check for lint errors and mark the task done.

## Todo List

- [x] Create API route to score confidence and insert into ClickHouse
- [x] Add @clickhouse/client dependency to package.json
- [x] Wire ChatTab to call API for new messages (incl. tests)

---

Status: I installed the ClickHouse client, added a new API route to rate confidence and insert rows into ClickHouse, and wired `ChatTab.tsx` to send each new message (including scenarios and generated tests) to that route once.

Plan:
- Add an API route that:
  - Converts message sentiment of confidence to a 1–5 integer via ChatGPT (with numeric fast-path like “4.4”).
  - Inserts records into ClickHouse with provided credentials.
- Install `@clickhouse/client`.
- Wire `ChatTab.tsx` to POST each new message to the API once, avoiding duplicates.

Edits made:
- app/api/log-confidence/route.ts: New route that:
  - Uses OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`) to output JSON {score: 1–5} or falls back to inline numeric parsing/heuristic.
  - Creates `class_pro_confidence` table if not exists.
  - Inserts row {ts, student, text, confidence} into ClickHouse using your credentials.
- components/ChatTab.tsx:
  - Added `loggedConfidenceIds` set.
  - On mount, primes it from any loaded local messages.
  - New effect triggers on new messages to POST to `/api/log-confidence` with `{ text, sender, timestamp }` and marks them as logged.

How to use:
- Run the app normally. As messages flow into Chat (manual input, scenario streams, or generated tests), each is scored and written to ClickHouse.

Minimal code references:
```1:79:app/api/log-confidence/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

```

Notes:
- I used your provided ClickHouse credentials directly, but also support env vars `CLICKHOUSE_URL`, `CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME`, `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` so you can move creds out of code later.
- The route also handles numeric-only messages like “4.4” without calling OpenAI, which saves tokens during scenario-3/4 test cases.

Next steps (optional):
- Add a simple dashboard query endpoint or page to read from `class_pro_confidence` grouped by `student` and time buckets for your graph.

_**User (2025-10-04 15:32Z)**_

okay look at the pulse tab help me generate queries I can place inside of  clickhouse to retrieve the required data

---

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Generating ClickHouse queries**

I need to help the user generate SQL queries for ClickHouse related to their query about the Pulse Tab. They're looking for queries to retrieve data from the `class_pro_confidence` table, which includes `ts`, `student`, `text`, and `confidence`. 

The queries should focus on time series to show average confidence over time and might include aggregations by student, such as averages and counts. Also, I'll consider how sessions are identified, though I currently lack a session ID for certain data types. I'll rely on a time-range window instead!
**Retrieving PulseTab metrics**

I need to create queries that filter results where `ts` is between a start and end time. I'll also cluster the data by time buckets to generate the required charts. It seems like the specifics for the metrics the user wants might be defined in the PulseTab component. I should check the `PulseTab.tsx` file to understand that better. So, I'll use the tools available to read that file and include any relevant status updates. Let's get started!</details></think>

---

Let me open the Pulse tab component to understand what metrics or views it needs, then I’ll draft ClickHouse SQL queries for those charts.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Querying for data metrics**

I need to create queries to retrieve data from ClickHouse for the 'class_pro_confidence' table. It has several columns including timestamps and student names. For the 'Student Messages,' I could count the rows where the student isn't 'You,' including messages from tests. We have to filter out entries from the instructor too. For 'Student Questions,' we don't have a clear logging of questions, so I might use regex to identify those ending with a '?'.
**Proposing approximate queries**

I see that 'studentQuestions' is just a mock-up for now, so I might suggest a query that counts instances where the text includes a question mark or look into using OpenAI's offline classification. For the 'Student Speaking Count', I can estimate the number of unique students who sent messages within a timeframe. 

For 'Sentiment Distribution', I could propose queries to count the confidence levels in specified intervals, adjusting for date ranges and session labels. Lastly, I'll consider averaging sentiment over time, grouping confidence by minute or five-minute intervals.
**Creating sentiment analysis queries**

I need to outline several queries to cluster responses by student and analyze sentiment over time during a session. 

First, for the overall distribution, I’ll select confidence levels and count occurrences grouped by confidence. For averaging over time, I could create a bucket every five minutes and find the average confidence. I will also create a query for average confidence per student over time to see individual trends. 

I'll add queries for the latest confidence levels per student and count messages, ensuring to exclude 'You.' For clarity, I'll also include counts for questions and distinct student speakers. The rolling window average could be calculated using moving averages—there's a lot to provide!
**Structuring SQL Queries for ClickHouse**

I see that ClickHouse supports window functions, like calculating averages based on student partitions. I’ll provide a basic example using `avg(confidence) OVER (PARTITION BY student ORDER BY bucket ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`. 

Since they might add a session ID later, I will frame the queries to accommodate that possibility while using date ranges as a workaround for now. I’ll prepare concise SQL statements, include variable placeholders, and format everything neatly with headings and bullet points, following their guidelines without excessive explanations. I'll start with a brief plan, then deliver the SQL code.
**Preparing SQL Queries for ClickHouse**

I opened PulseTab to identify metrics and will provide ClickHouse SQL. For our tasks, since the earlier to-do list is complete, we will focus on specific queries without needing the to-do system this time.

1. Define a time range with requests to the `class_pro_confidence` table.
2. Present queries covering sentiment distribution, averages over time, per-student details, rolling averages, message counts, and distinct speaking students.

Next, I'll summarize the plan and present each SQL query in structured code blocks, using concise language and proper headings.</details></think>

---

I opened `components/PulseTab.tsx` to identify the metrics (distribution 1–5, average over time, counts) and will give ClickHouse SQL you can paste directly.

Plan:
- Use `class_pro_confidence(ts DateTime, student String, text String, confidence UInt8)`.
- Provide copy-paste SQL for distribution, time-series, per-student clustering, and simple counts.

Queries:

- Overall 1–5 distribution (last hour)
```sql
SELECT
  confidence,
  count() AS cnt
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY confidence
ORDER BY confidence;
```

- Overall average sentiment over time (5-min buckets)
```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfFiveMinute(ts) AS bucket,
  avg(confidence) AS avg_conf
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket;
```

- Distribution by student (1–5 counts)
```sql
SELECT
  student,
  confidence,
  count() AS cnt
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY student, confidence
ORDER BY student, confidence;
```

- Average over time by student (use top N most active students)
```sql
WITH top_students AS (
  SELECT student
  FROM class_pro_confidence
  WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
  GROUP BY student
  ORDER BY count() DESC
  LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
  t.student,
  toStartOfFiveMinute(t.ts) AS bucket,
  avg(t.confidence) AS avg_conf
FROM class_pro_confidence AS t
INNER JOIN top_students USING (student)
WHERE t.ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY t.student, bucket
ORDER BY bucket, t.student;
```

- Latest confidence per student (and when it occurred)
```sql
SELECT
  student,
  argMax(confidence, ts) AS last_confidence,
  max(ts) AS last_ts
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY student
ORDER BY student;
```

- Rolling avg confidence per student (4-window over 5-min buckets)
```sql
WITH b AS (
  SELECT
    student,
    toStartOfFiveMinute(ts) AS bucket,
    avg(confidence) AS avg_conf
  FROM class_pro_confidence
  WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
  GROUP BY student, bucket
)
SELECT
  student,
  bucket,
  avg_conf,
  avg(avg_conf) OVER (
    PARTITION BY student
    ORDER BY bucket
    ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS avg_conf_roll4
FROM b
ORDER BY student, bucket;
```

- Student messages count (exclude ‘You’)
```sql
SELECT count() AS student_messages
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
  AND student != 'You';
```

- Student questions (naive: messages containing '?')
```sql
SELECT countIf(positionCaseInsensitive(text, '?') > 0) AS student_questions
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
  AND student != 'You';
```

- Distinct speaking students
```sql
SELECT uniqExact(student) AS student_speaking_count
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
  AND student != 'You';
```

- Stacked distribution over time (for a stacked bar/area)
```sql
SELECT
  toStartOfFiveMinute(ts) AS bucket,
  confidence,
  count() AS cnt
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY bucket, confidence
ORDER BY bucket, confidence;
```

- Students with most low-confidence messages (threshold ≤ 2)
```sql
SELECT
  student,
  countIf(confidence <= 2) AS low_cnt,
  avg(confidence <= 2) AS low_ratio,
  count() AS total
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY student
HAVING total >= 3
ORDER BY low_ratio DESC, low_cnt DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

- Per-student summary (avg, p25/p50/p75, counts) for last hour
```sql
SELECT
  student,
  avg(confidence) AS avg_conf,
  quantileExact(0.25)(confidence) AS p25,
  quantileExact(0.50)(confidence) AS p50,
  quantileExact(0.75)(confidence) AS p75,
  count() AS n
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY student
ORDER BY avg_conf DESC;
```

- If you later add a session_id, filter with it:
```sql
-- Replace 'SESSION_ID' with actual session id
SELECT
  toStartOfFiveMinute(ts) AS bucket,
  avg(confidence) AS avg_conf
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE session_id = 'SESSION_ID'
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket;
```

Steps taken:
- Reviewed `PulseTab` to match its needs (counts, distribution, avg over time).
- Targeted `class_pro_confidence` and provided ready-to-run SQL covering distribution, time-series, per-student clustering, latest values, rolling averages, and simple counters.

_**User (2025-10-04 15:32Z)**_

how can I quickly load these into clickhouse

---

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring ClickHouse loading techniques**

I see the user wants to know how to quickly load something into ClickHouse. Are they referring to running queries or loading datasets? It looks more like they want to execute the queries quickly using their credentials. I should provide some methods, like using the ClickHouse Cloud UI to run SQL directly in the console and possibly the clickhouse-client via secure TCP for CLI access. Let's simplify this for them!
**Detailing ClickHouse loading methods**

I see the user is looking for ways to quickly load data into ClickHouse. They might benefit from using HTTPS with the clickhouse-client, ensuring to use secure connections with their credentials. I should also mention using HTTP with curl for POST queries or running a Node script with @clickhouse/client. Additionally, creating views for reusability is a good idea. I need to provide step-by-step commands while being concise, avoiding unnecessary fluff, and not exposing sensitive information.
**Explaining ClickHouse imports and views**

It looks like the user wants to import queries to ClickHouse as "saved queries" or "views." I should mention the "Saved queries" feature in the Cloud UI, where they can save from the SQL Console. I’ll provide examples like "CREATE VIEW v_confidence_distribution AS <query>." It’s better to use "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW" since newer versions support it—though using "CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS ..." is safer. I can also suggest sequences like "DROP VIEW IF EXISTS" along with creating the relevant database and table, ensuring everything is ready for a quick load.
**Sharing methods to load queries into ClickHouse**

I notice the user wants a fast way to load queries into ClickHouse. To help, I can provide "curl" commands for quick execution, like `curl -u default:yABbAN.S3f0Og 'https://...:8443/?default_format=JSON' --data-binary "SELECT ..."`. I'll suggest a Node script approach with createClient for executing queries. The main focus will be on the three fastest methods: the ClickHouse Cloud SQL console, curl commands, and a Node one-liner. I'll include code blocks, emphasize creating views for reusability, and use absolute paths for a macOS environment.
**Structuring the ClickHouse loading plan**

I'm working on a plan for the user to run queries in ClickHouse. The options include: 1) running directly in the Cloud UI; 2) using curl; 3) executing through a Node script; and 4) optionally creating reusable views. I’ll provide minimal, numbered steps for the UI and a curl template with the base URL and a sample query. For the Node script, I'll include a function to run the SQL.

Status: I’ll give you the fastest ways to run those queries against your ClickHouse Cloud now, plus optional “CREATE VIEW” definitions so you can save/reuse them in the UI.

Plan:
- Use any of: Cloud SQL Console (fastest), curl over HTTP, or a tiny Node script.
- Optionally create views so you don’t keep pasting queries.

Quickest options

- Cloud SQL Console (fastest)
  - Open ClickHouse Cloud → SQL Console.
  - Paste any query and run. Example:
```sql
SELECT confidence, count() AS cnt
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY confidence
ORDER BY confidence;
```

- curl (no install beyond curl)
```bash
curl -u default:yABbAN.S3f0Og \
  'https://d8irwr6qnd.us-east1.gcp.clickhouse.cloud:8443/?database=default&default_format=PrettyCompact' \
  --data-binary "SELECT toStartOfFiveMinute(ts) AS bucket, avg(confidence) AS avg_conf FROM class_pro_confidence WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR GROUP BY bucket ORDER BY bucket;"
```

- Node one-off runner (uses your existing project deps)
```bash
node -e "import('@clickhouse/client').then(async m=>{const c=m.createClient({url:'https://d8irwr6qnd.us-east1.gcp.clickhouse.cloud:8443',username:'default',password:'yABbAN.S3f0Og'});const q=await c.query({query:`SELECT toStartOfFiveMinute(ts) AS bucket, avg(confidence) AS avg_conf FROM class_pro_confidence WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR GROUP BY bucket ORDER BY bucket`,format:'JSONEachRow'});console.log(await q.json());process.exit(0)})"
```

Optional: create saved views (so charts and future queries are simple)

- Distribution 1–5 (last hour)
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_confidence_distribution_last_hour;
CREATE VIEW v_confidence_distribution_last_hour AS
SELECT confidence, count() AS cnt
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY confidence
ORDER BY confidence;
```

- Average over time (5-min buckets, last 2 hours)
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_avg_conf_5m_last_2h;
CREATE VIEW v_avg_conf_5m_last_2h AS
SELECT toStartOfFiveMinute(ts) AS bucket, avg(confidence) AS avg_conf
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY bucket
ORDER BY bucket;
```

- Distribution by student (last 2 hours)
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_distribution_by_student_last_2h;
CREATE VIEW v_distribution_by_student_last_2h AS
SELECT student, confidence, count() AS cnt
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY student, confidence
ORDER BY student, confidence;
```

- Average over time by top 10 students (last 2 hours)
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_avg_5m_by_top_students_last_2h;
CREATE VIEW v_avg_5m_by_top_students_last_2h AS
WITH top_students AS (
  SELECT student
  FROM class_pro_confidence
  WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
  GROUP BY student
  ORDER BY count() DESC
  LIMIT 10
)
SELECT t.student, toStartOfFiveMinute(t.ts) AS bucket, avg(t.confidence) AS avg_conf
FROM class_pro_confidence AS t
INNER JOIN top_students USING (student)
WHERE t.ts >= now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR
GROUP BY t.student, bucket
ORDER BY bucket, t.student;
```

- Latest confidence per student
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_latest_conf_by_student;
CREATE VIEW v_latest_conf_by_student AS
SELECT student, argMax(confidence, ts) AS last_confidence, max(ts) AS last_ts
FROM class_pro_confidence
GROUP BY student
ORDER BY student;
```

Minimal steps
- Use Cloud SQL Console → paste/run queries above.
- Or run the curl command with your URL/user/password.
- If you want reuse, run the CREATE VIEW statements once; then query the views directly.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning API Updates**

I’m planning to fetch data on mount and set the state for a client component with custom charts. I’ll need to map the returned data shapes and handle errors gracefully while keeping the UI visuals consistent.

Next, I need to implement some code edits via apply_patch and create new API files. The first task is to set up an API route for distribution counts over the last specified time. The second one will return average values in 5-minute buckets for two hours, with parameters for flexibility in time windows.
**Updating ClickHouse API Routes**

In ClickHouse, I can use `toStartOfInterval(ts, INTERVAL 5 MINUTE)` or `toStartOfFiveMinute` depending on the context. For a fixed 5-minute bucket, I’ll stick with `toStartOfFiveMinute`, but if it’s more generic, `toStartOfInterval` will work.

Next, I'll set up an API route for summarizing student messages and questions, using a time window parameter. I’ll replace mock variables in `PulseTab` with actual state, fetch the necessary data on mount, and convert data shapes to match the current chart requirements, like computing average reports and preparing for the line chart.
**Creating API Routes**

The API will return a bucket formatted as HH:mm. I’ll gather statistics like `studentMessages`, `studentQuestions`, and `studentSpeakingCount` from the summary. If there’s no data, I’ll ensure to keep zeros or fallback to default arrays. 

I need to make sure that new routes compile without using server-only imports outside of `NextRequest/NextResponse` and `@clickhouse/client`. Next, I’ll proceed to create three API routes and update the component, following good API code style. The first step is to parse URL search params and build the SQL query accordingly.
**Setting Up ClickHouse API Routes**

The JS client supports query parameters, and the ClickHouse client has a params property, but I’ll keep it simple by embedding the minutes directly into the query. The response will be in JSON format.

For the `avg-over-time` route, I’ll set defaults for minutes (120) and bucket size (5). The SQL query will average confidence over time intervals defined by the bucket size. 

For the `summary` route, I’ll also default minutes to 120 and gather counts for student messages, questions, and speaking counts. All routes will return JSON formatted correctly.
**Updating PulseTab**

I'll start by updating PulseTab to include a `useEffect` for fetching data.

I need to set up state variables for `studentMessages`, `studentQuestions`, `studentSpeakingCount`, and `sentimentDistribution`, which will default to [0,0,0,0,0]. I'll calculate `averageSelfReport` based on distribution and initialize `avgSentimentOverTime` as empty.

On component mount, I'll implement the fetch logic and set these states accordingly. I'll ensure to keep the 'use client' directive and proper indentation while handling fetch responses and errors. Let's get this implemented!</details></think>

---

I'll add three API endpoints to query ClickHouse for distribution, average over time, and summary metrics, then update the Pulse tab to fetch and display this live data.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I'm adding a state to manage loading and error handling with `useState`. I'm also setting up data states for `studentMessages` and other items, including a distribution array length of 5 and an average over time array. The labels will be computed from bucket timestamps. A refresh button might be added, although the user didn’t specifically request it. It’s important to check for linter errors, so I’ll run a lint check on the modified files before proceeding with the implementation.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating PulseTab functionality**

I need to update PulseTab to call our API endpoints for live data. First, I'll use apply_patch to edit the file while maintaining the indentation style, which appears to be two spaces from what I see. I'll import useEffect and useState since it's a client component. For now, PulseTab relies on mock data constants, but I’ll replace those with a state that fetches data. 

I also need to calculate distributions and averages from the API results, create a couple of functions, and implement loading states and error handling. Lastly, I'll ensure lints pass.
**Converting distribution data**

I need to update the distribution data conversion since the API returns an array of objects. I'll map that to an array of counts with a length of five, taking values based on the index. The average over time line chart expects a {label: string; value: number} format. I’ll convert the timestamp strings returned by ClickHouse to a readable HH:MM format while keeping things simple. 

I also want to implement a timeframe selection with parameters for fetching. After updating, I'll run read_lints on the file, mark it complete, and provide a summary. I’ll make sure to confirm server endpoints exist and implement a refresh timer without heavily modifying charts.</details></think>

---

I'll update `components/PulseTab.tsx` to fetch live data from the new Pulse API endpoints, map it into the existing chart components, and display summary stats. Then I’ll run a quick lint check and mark the UI task complete.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating PulseTab Component**

I need to update PulseTab.tsx to fetch from our new API endpoints. We tried applying a patch but hit a context mismatch, probably because the file is still on the mock version. I see now that we need to modify it. I have to import React hooks like useEffect, useMemo, and useState, which aren’t currently imported. The file only has 'use client' and doesn't use hooks, so I'll add those imports. It’s also important not to disrupt the existing indentation style, which uses two spaces. I'll ensure to keep everything aligned while updating the component to use state variables and effects for fetching.
**Modifying Sentiment Report**

I’m planning to change the heading from "Sentiment Report" to "Sentiment self-report distribution (1–5)" to keep consistency with a previous attempt, as that original version uses the same wording. We need to keep our code clean and use tools instead of coding directly. The plan involves editing the file by importing the necessary React hooks, then updating the PulseTab function with new state variables and useEffect. We’ll ensure to keep the original context in mind while applying these minimal changes. Let’s get that patch crafted!
**Updating PulseTab Function**

I need to replace the current content inside the PulseTab function with updated state management using the useState hook. The original function has mock data for student messages and sentiment distributions, which I will replace with state variables like minutes, stepMinutes, and sentimentDistribution, each initialized accordingly. I’ll use useMemo to calculate the average self-report. Plus, I plan to set up useEffect for fetching data every 10 seconds. The return statement will remain unchanged, though I’ll keep an eye on label texts for average self-report. Let's keep it clean and minimal!
**Creating Apply Patch**

I’ve decided not to add a UI for changing minutes or step; it doesn't seem necessary. Plus, since we’re using TypeScript, I’ll need to add types. I’ll create an apply patch with two editing snippets. First, I’ll add the import line right after the 'use client' declaration. The old code snippet should match exactly as it appears. For the second edit, I’ll replace the section in the PulseTab function that defines variables and constants right before the return statement. Let's get that patch crafted correctly!
**Replacing Function Lines**

I’m looking to find the exact text for the PulseTab function to replace lines 140-162 with new state management and effects. Once I craft the patch, I’ll run lints to ensure everything compiles correctly. I also need to mark the UI as completed in the to-do list. I’m confirming that the endpoints for Next.js have already been added, which is great! I’ll double-check the types in TypeScript, especially since it's TSX, and confirm that I’m correctly using the BarChart and LineChart components. Now, I'll implement the apply_patch!</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] Create Pulse API endpoints: distribution, avg-over-time, summary
- [x] Wire PulseTab to fetch and render live ClickHouse data

---

Status: I added three API endpoints that query ClickHouse and updated `PulseTab.tsx` to fetch and render live data every 10s for the selected time window.

Plan:
- Keep the UI and queries decoupled via `/api/pulse/*`.
- Pulse tab now shows: summary counts, 1–5 distribution, and average over time from ClickHouse.

Changes:
- app/api/pulse/distribution/route.ts
- app/api/pulse/avg-over-time/route.ts
- app/api/pulse/summary/route.ts
- components/PulseTab.tsx

What it does:
- Summary: GET `/api/pulse/summary?minutes=120` returns `student_messages`, `student_questions`, `student_speaking_count`, `avg_conf`.
- Distribution: GET `/api/pulse/distribution?minutes=120` returns rows `{confidence,cnt}`, mapped to 5 bins.
- Average over time: GET `/api/pulse/avg-over-time?minutes=120&stepMinutes=5` returns `{bucket,avg_conf}`; labels shown as HH:MM.
- `PulseTab.tsx` fetches all three and updates charts and numbers; refetches every 10 seconds.

Note:
- Credentials are read from env if set, else fall back to your provided values. For production, set `CLICKHOUSE_URL`, `CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME`, `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`.

- To adjust window/granularity, tweak `minutes` and `stepMinutes` at the top of `PulseTab.tsx`.
