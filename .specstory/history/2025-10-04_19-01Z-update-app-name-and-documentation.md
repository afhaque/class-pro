<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to update the app name and project description. Let me first check what the current app name is and what's in the README and other descriptive files.

I should:
1. Read the README.md to see what it currently says
2. Check package.json for the app name
3. Look at any other relevant files that might contain app descriptions
4. Ask the user what the new name should be, or infer from the project structure what it should be called

Let me start by reading these files to understand the current state.</details></think>

I'll help you update the app name and project description. Let me first check the current README and package.json to see what needs to be updated.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the files, I can see:
1. The package.json currently has `"name": "nextjs"` which is generic
2. The README.md is just the default Next.js boilerplate
3. The project is called "class-pro" based on the directory name
4. Based on the features I can see (video calling, transcription, translation, chat, pulse tracking), this appears to be a classroom/education platform with real-time translation and analytics

Let me infer what this app does based on the features:
- Daily.co video integration for video calls
- Real-time transcription
- Chat with multi-language translation (DeepL)
- Pulse/analytics tracking (sentiment analysis with ClickHouse)
- Teacher and student views
- Real-time communication for classrooms

This seems to be a multilingual classroom platform. I'll update the name to "ClassPro" and write a comprehensive README that describes all these features.</details></think>

Based on the project structure and features I can see (video calls, live transcription, multi-language chat translation, pulse analytics), I'll update the app name and create a comprehensive README describing this multilingual classroom platform.

**Plan:**
1. Update package.json with the new app name "ClassPro"
2. Rewrite README.md with proper project description and features
3. Update relevant references in ENV_SETUP.md

## Summary

I've updated the app name and project documentation:

### Changes Made:

1. **package.json** - Updated app name from "nextjs" to "class-pro"

2. **README.md** - Completely rewritten with:
   - Comprehensive project description highlighting the multilingual classroom platform
   - Detailed feature sections for video, transcription, translation, chat, and analytics
   - Complete tech stack documentation
   - Installation and setup instructions
   - Project structure overview
   - Usage guides for teachers and students
   - Contributing guidelines

3. **app/layout.tsx** - Updated metadata:
   - Title: "ClassPro - Multilingual Classroom Platform"
   - Description: Describes the core features (video, transcription, translation, analytics)

The README now properly reflects ClassPro as a real-time multilingual education platform that enables teachers to conduct video classes with automatic transcription and translation across 12+ languages, complete with student engagement analytics.
