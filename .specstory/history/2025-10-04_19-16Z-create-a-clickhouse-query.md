<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching for ClickHouse queries**

I need to respond to the user's request for a ClickHouse query related to "Highest Sentiment Students" and "Lowest Sentiment Students." First, I should check the data schema and search the codebase for any existing ClickHouse usage related to sentiment. I'll use the codebase_search tool to find where sentiment scores are stored and any relevant tables. I’ll run multiple searches with terms like "clickhouse," "pulse," and "sentiment." Let's get started on these tool calls!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the codebase to find how sentiment is stored and queried (tables, columns, existing ClickHouse queries), so I can craft highest/lowest student queries aligned with your schema.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Crafting SQL queries**

I’m focusing on using ORDER BY with tuple() to match what’s needed for CH SQL. I see that the code involves using `createClient` queries with a template string in the format of JSONEachRow, so I’ll need to craft the query accordingly. I might also consider proposing something more advanced, like using quantileExact or anyLast, but that might not be necessary for this case.
**Crafting SQL queries**

I’m looking to create queries for fetching the top and bottom N students. For the top N, I’ll select the student with the average confidence and message count while excluding 'You.' I need to group by student and apply constraints accordingly, then order the results. 

For the combined query, I’ll use a common table expression (CTE) to aggregate the data. I also noticed that CH doesn’t allow an ORDER BY on the entire union, so I’ll handle that carefully to maintain the order.
**Working on ClickHouse queries**

I’m considering a variant to compute values per window without needing 'toStartOfMinute.' We can also look at getting the top or lowest last message value instead of the average. The screenshot showing “Highest Sentiment Students” and “Lowest Sentiment Students” suggests the need for clarity. The code for the TA agent currently chooses "last" for each student, but for our purposes, it seems better to use the average across the window. 

I'll propose a query that utilizes `groupArraySort` to get these values in two arrays.
**Structuring the final plan**

It's more convenient to display both lists with their scores, so we’ll need to include parallel arrays using `groupArray((student, avg_conf))`. I plan to provide the details in an organized way: first a plan, then the code, followed by a simplified outline of the steps taken.

I won’t be modifying the code or calling new tools. I’ll craft a final message that includes an example of usage in Next route with parameter substitution. I’ll structure everything with headings and keep the code blocks in plain SQL format using markdown. That should cover everything!</details></think>

---

I’m going to craft ClickHouse queries that return the top and bottom students by average confidence over a time window, excluding `student = 'You'`. I’ll give both separate queries and a single-query variant that returns both lists.

### Plan
- Compute per-student aggregates in a time window: `avg(confidence)`, `count()`.
- Exclude `student = 'You'`. Optionally filter by a minimum message count.
- Return:
  - Highest Sentiment Students: top K by `avg_conf DESC`.
  - Lowest Sentiment Students: top K by `avg_conf ASC`.
- Provide a combined UNION ALL version and an array-returning version.

### Queries

Separate queries (simple, explicit)
```sql
-- Top K highest sentiment students
SELECT
  student,
  round(avg(confidence), 2) AS avg_conf,
  count() AS msgs
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL {minutes:Int32} MINUTE
  AND student != 'You'
GROUP BY student
HAVING msgs >= {min_msgs:Int32}  -- e.g. 1 or 2 to reduce noise
ORDER BY avg_conf DESC, msgs DESC, student ASC
LIMIT {k:Int32};

-- Top K lowest sentiment students
SELECT
  student,
  round(avg(confidence), 2) AS avg_conf,
  count() AS msgs
FROM class_pro_confidence
WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL {minutes:Int32} MINUTE
  AND student != 'You'
GROUP BY student
HAVING msgs >= {min_msgs:Int32}
ORDER BY avg_conf ASC, msgs DESC, student ASC
LIMIT {k:Int32};
```

Single query returning both (two result sets stacked)
```sql
WITH agg AS
(
  SELECT
    student,
    round(avg(confidence), 2) AS avg_conf,
    count() AS msgs
  FROM class_pro_confidence
  WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL {minutes:Int32} MINUTE
    AND student != 'You'
  GROUP BY student
  HAVING msgs >= {min_msgs:Int32}
)
SELECT 'highest' AS kind, student, avg_conf, msgs
FROM agg
ORDER BY avg_conf DESC, msgs DESC, student ASC
LIMIT {k:Int32}
UNION ALL
SELECT 'lowest' AS kind, student, avg_conf, msgs
FROM agg
ORDER BY avg_conf ASC, msgs DESC, student ASC
LIMIT {k:Int32};
```

Single row with arrays (handy if your UI wants both lists in one row)
```sql
WITH agg AS
(
  SELECT
    student,
    round(avg(confidence), 2) AS avg_conf,
    count() AS msgs
  FROM class_pro_confidence
  WHERE ts >= now() - INTERVAL {minutes:Int32} MINUTE
    AND student != 'You'
  GROUP BY student
  HAVING msgs >= {min_msgs:Int32}
)
SELECT
  arraySlice(groupArray((student, avg_conf)) ORDER BY avg_conf DESC, 1, {k:Int32}) AS top_students,
  arraySlice(groupArray((student, avg_conf)) ORDER BY avg_conf ASC, 1, {k:Int32})  AS bottom_students;
```

Notes:
- Replace `{minutes}`, `{k}`, `{min_msgs}` with your values or client-side parameters.
- Keep `HAVING msgs >= ...` to avoid ranking students with only one message, if desired.

### Steps I took
- Reviewed your schema (`class_pro_confidence`: `ts`, `student`, `text`, `confidence`).
- Designed per-student aggregation for the time window.
- Produced both separate and combined query options tailored to your Pulse cards.

update teh pulse tab to use these new queries.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating API Queries**

I'm considering the prompt about updating the pulse tab with new queries to find top and bottom students. I need to figure out whether to implement a new API, 'pulse/top-bottom', or modify the existing PulseTab to call two queries directly through ClickHouse. However, I remember that the frontend shouldn't connect to ClickHouse directly; it should utilize API routes instead. I should check the current setup in PulseTab.tsx to understand how it's currently structured for displaying sentiment data.</details></think>

---

I'll first inspect `components/PulseTab.tsx` to see how it's currently fetching top/bottom students, and check existing pulse API routes to decide whether to add a new route or extend an existing one. Then I'll implement the API and update the component to use it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating API for Pulse Tab**

I need to update the Pulse Tab to incorporate new queries for identifying students with the highest and lowest sentiment. Currently, it calls non-existent endpoints. I’ll implement two new routes specifically for these API calls. The existing component uses separate endpoints, so I’ll ensure we create those and adjust the return data format accordingly. Additionally, I'll handle parameters like minutes and limit, including making `min_msgs` optional. Let's streamline this process!
**Implementing API Endpoints**

I’m setting up two new API routes for the Pulse Tab: one for top students and one for bottom students. Each will handle parameters like minutes, limit, and min_msgs. Though I could create a combined route, it seems easier to stick to two separate ones to match the current code. I need to ensure the response correctly maps to `student_id` and `avg_conf`, and I’ll also apply some string filtering for the term "You." After that, let’s run the lints!
**Creating To-Do List and API Endpoints**

I need to create a to-do list for medium tasks based on developer instructions. The items will include adding the top-students and bottom-students APIs, along with verifying the component fetch. I'll use the to-do tool and ensure we maintain a two-space indentation style for the TypeScript files. We’ll also import '@clickhouse/client' and implement error handling. After writing the tasks and adding the files, I might check for lints, even though the `PulseTab.tsx` file doesn’t need updates.
**Writing Top Route Code**

I’m setting up the code for the top-students route, ensuring we return JSON rows with the required fields: `student_id` and `avg_conf`. The file will be located at `/Users/ahmedhaque/CodeWork/class-pro/app/api/pulse/top-students/route.ts`. I’ll import the necessary modules and create a GET handler to define parameters like minutes and limit. The SQL query will group students while filtering out the 'You' string and returning data formatted correctly. I need to confirm that ClickHouse allows referencing aliases in the HAVING clause properly.
**Implementing HAVING Clause and Routes**

In ClickHouse, I need to be careful with the HAVING clause. Instead of using the alias, I’ll directly use `HAVING count() >= ${minMsgs}`, which is safer. The ORDER BY clause can use the `avg_conf` alias without any issues. For the bottom-students route, I'll ensure it orders by `avg_conf ASC`. After implementing these routes, there won’t be any changes needed to PulseTab. It might be good to run read_lints on the new files. I’ll start with writing the tasks and creating both route files.</details></think>

---

I’m going to add two API routes: `api/pulse/top-students` and `api/pulse/bottom-students`, each querying ClickHouse for highest/lowest average confidence in a time window, then update nothing in `PulseTab.tsx` since it already calls these endpoints. I'll create both files now and then run a lint check on them.

I need to read the specific files to identify the exact line numbers. Currently, I have the files ready for editing, but I'm missing those numbers. I can re-open the files using the read_file tool to gather this information, which will help me provide code references. 

Additionally, I think we should adjust the fetch calls in `PulseTab.tsx` to include the minMsgs parameter, likely setting it to 1 or 2. It seems adding a default of 1 might be a good approach. 

Before tackling new edits, I should confirm that all tasks on the to-do list are reconciled. After reviewing, I can provide a summary according to the specifications and include relevant code snippets. I'll focus on the lines related to the fetchTopBottom function for clarity.
**Fetching code references**

We've already done the groundwork, so I can provide code references with the specific line numbers 134-147 — that should meet the requirements. I’ll fetch those line numbers, as I have the content from the read_file tool.

For clarity, I’ll show the queries in route.ts, particularly the lines that include SELECT statements. I should also open the new top-students route file with read_file to ensure I get the correct line numbers. This will help organize the code references for a clear presentation.</details></think>

I'll pull the exact lines added for the new API routes and the section in `PulseTab.tsx` that calls them, so you can see the queries and confirm the wiring.

Status: I added two new ClickHouse-backed endpoints and verified there are no linter errors. `PulseTab.tsx` already calls these routes, so no component edits were needed.

Plan
- Create `api/pulse/top-students` and `api/pulse/bottom-students` using your new queries.
- Keep query params: `minutes`, `limit`, optional `minMsgs`.
- Reuse existing client pattern and JSONEachRow parsing.

Key edits
```1:45:app/api/pulse/top-students/route.ts

    const minMsgs = Math.max(1, Math.min(1000, Number(searchParams.get('minMsgs')) || 1));

    const client = getClient();

    const query = `

    `;

    const rows = await client.query({ query, format: 'JSONEachRow' });
    const data = await rows.json<Array<{ student_id: string; avg_conf: number; msgs: number }>>();

    return NextResponse.json({ ok: true, data });
  } catch (e: any) {
    console.error('pulse/bottom-students error', e);
    return NextResponse.json({ ok: false, error: e?.message || 'Unknown error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

Usage in `PulseTab.tsx` (already present)
```134:147:components/PulseTab.tsx
const [topRes, bottomRes] = await Promise.all([
  fetch(`/api/pulse/top-students?minutes=${minutes}&limit=5`),
  fetch(`/api/pulse/bottom-students?minutes=${minutes}&limit=5`)
]);
...
```

Steps taken
- Added two new API routes using your new ClickHouse queries.
- Returned `student_id`, `avg_conf`, `msgs`; kept parameters `minutes`, `limit`, `minMsgs`.
- Verified `PulseTab.tsx` already integrates with these endpoints.
- Ran lints on the new files; no errors.

If you want a single combined endpoint that returns both lists in one call, I can add `api/pulse/top-bottom` with the UNION/array approach.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing BarChart features**

I see that the file already has 'use client' at the top, which means I can import useState inside the BarChart component since useEffect, useMemo, and useState are already imported. I'll consider adding a `labels?: string[]` prop, but I think I can compute the labels using `i + 1`. I also need to set up state for hover with `const [hover, setHover] = useState<number | null>(null)`.  

On the rect group, I’ll add mouse event handlers for hover effects and handle the tooltip positioning relative to the bar. It should be a rounded rectangle with a white fill and border, displaying values like "Level 3: 27 (48%)".
**Updating BarChart for interactivity**

I'm looking at how to enhance the BarChart with some key features. First, I'll compute the `totalCount` from the data using `data.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)`. I want to maintain the existing average vertical line and label. I also need to add an accessible title in the `<title>` tag.

For mobile users, enabling touch interactions to toggle onClick sounds like a good idea! I should ensure none of these modifications break the existing style. I'll implement a `total` calculation and compute label string values in the map. Adding event handlers is also necessary, along with tooltip functionality that shows counts and percentages when the bar is hovered over.
**Configuring tooltip positioning**

I’m working on positioning the tooltip with a calculation: `const tooltipY = Math.max(padding, y - 22)`. I could explore using a dynamic width for the rect based on text length, but that could complicate things. Instead, I'll approximate a fixed width of 80, which seems reasonable. The label will then be in the format `Count {value} • {pct}%`, and for width, I'll compute `const labelW = Math.max(48, 10 + label.length * 6)`.

I'll also add an `onMouseMove` event to reposition the tooltip while keeping it anchored above the bar. To enhance accessibility, I’ll include a `<title>` tag as a native tooltip too, which should satisfy the need for "roll over details."
**Modifying BarChart for visual details**

It seems the user wants visual details shown as bubbles, so I’ll add that to the BarChart as well. I need to modify the code carefully using `apply_patch`, ensuring that spaces and indentation are preserved without reformatting.  

In the UI, I notice that the `Sentiment Report` card has the BarChart embedded within a scroll container, which looks good, and no new API is necessary. Even though the style suggests avoiding inline comments, I’ll include minimal comments as needed. Let’s implement these changes!</details></think>

I'll add hover tooltips to the Sentiment Report bar chart by updating `components/PulseTab.tsx`'s `BarChart` to track hovered bars and render a tooltip with count and percent above the bar, plus a native title attribute. Then I'll run a linter check on the edited file.

Status: I updated the Sentiment Report chart to show hover tooltips with counts and percentages; lint is clean.

Plan
- Track hovered bar in `BarChart` and render a lightweight tooltip above it.
- Include native `<title>` for accessibility.
- Keep styles consistent with your green accent.

What changed
```100:147:components/PulseTab.tsx
const totalValue = Math.max(1, data.reduce((sum, v) => sum + v, 0));
const [hoverIndex, setHoverIndex] = useState<number | null>(null);

{data.map((value, i) => {
  const pct = Math.round((value / totalValue) * 100);
  const isHover = hoverIndex === i;
  ...
  <rect
    ...
    onMouseEnter={() => setHoverIndex(i)}
    onMouseLeave={() => setHoverIndex(null)}
  >
    <title>{`Level ${i + 1}: ${value} messages (${pct}%)`}</title>
  </rect>
  {isHover && (
    <g pointerEvents="none">
      <rect ... fill="#FFFFFF" stroke="#CDEFE3" />
      <text ... fill="#00B386" fontWeight={600}>{`${value} (${pct}%)`}</text>
    </g>
  )}
})}
```

Steps taken
- Computed total to derive percent.
- Added hover state with `onMouseEnter/Leave`.
- Rendered tooltip group above active bar and kept axis/labels unchanged.
