# Transcription Implementation Fixes

Based on the [Daily transcription documentation](https://docs.daily.co/guides/products/transcription), the following fixes were applied:

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Event Structure (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: The code was accessing `event.transcriptionData` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**: According to Daily's docs, the `transcription-message` event object directly contains the fields:
- `text` - The transcribed text
- `participantId` - ID of the speaking participant  
- `timestamp` - When the transcript was generated
- `is_final` - Whether this is interim or final transcript
- `session_id` - Session identifier

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
const { text, participantId } = event.transcriptionData;

// AFTER (correct):
const { text, participantId, timestamp, is_final, session_id } = event;
```

### 2. Captured Transcript ID
The `transcription-started` event returns a `transcriptId` which can be used with Daily's REST APIs for:
- Querying transcription status
- Retrieving stored transcripts (WebVTT format)
- Managing transcription sessions

### 3. Improved Message Handling
- Better deduplication of interim vs final messages
- Use actual timestamp from event instead of generating new one
- Improved participant name resolution (fallback to user_id)

### 4. Simplified Configuration
Removed unnecessary transcription parameters. Daily's default settings work well:
```typescript
// Simple call - uses sensible defaults
await callObject.startTranscription();

// Optional: You can still configure if needed
await callObject.startTranscription({
  language: 'en',
  participants: ['specific-participant-id']
});
```

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Clarified that transcription is pay-as-you-go (available on all plans, not just Enterprise)
- Added permission requirements (`canAdmin: 'transcription'`)
- Included proper troubleshooting steps
- Added link to official Daily documentation

## How Transcription Works

1. **User joins the call** (must be in `joined-meeting` state)
2. **Start transcription** by clicking "Start Transcription" button
3. **Daily emits events**:
   - `transcription-started` - Returns `transcriptId`
   - `transcription-message` - Streams interim and final transcripts
   - `transcription-stopped` - When transcription ends
   - `transcription-error` - If errors occur
4. **UI displays** interim (italic) and final (highlighted) transcripts

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Join a call successfully
- [ ] Click "Start Transcription" button
- [ ] Speak into microphone
- [ ] See interim transcripts appear (gray, italic)
- [ ] See final transcripts appear (blue background)
- [ ] Verify participant names are correct
- [ ] Check console for `transcriptId`
- [ ] Test with multiple participants
- [ ] Verify stop transcription works
- [ ] Test error handling (try starting before joining)

## Common Issues

### Empty Error Object
- Usually means you're trying to start transcription before joining the call
- Solution: Wait for `meetingState === 'joined-meeting'`

### No Transcripts Appearing
- Check that microphone is enabled
- Verify you're speaking loud enough
- Look for `transcription-message` events in console
- Ensure "live captions" is enabled in room settings

### Permission Errors
- Meeting owners automatically have transcription permission
- Other users need `canAdmin: 'transcription'` permission
- Grant via meeting tokens or `updateParticipant()` call
